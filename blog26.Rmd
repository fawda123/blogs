<p>I'm pleased to announce that my second R package, SWMPr, has been <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SWMPr/">posted on CRAN</a>. I developed this package to work with water quality time series data from the System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS). SWMP was established in 1995 to provide continuous environmental data at over 300 fixed stations in 28 estuaries of the United States (more info <a href="http://www.nerrs.noaa.gov/Default.aspx">here</a>). SWMP data are collected with the general objective of describing dynamics of estuarine ecosystems to better inform coastal management. However, simple tools for processing and evaluating the increasing quantity of data provided by the monitoring network have complicated broad-scale comparisons between systems and, in some cases, simple trend analysis of water quality parameters at individual sites. The SWMPr package was developed to address common challenges of working with SWMP data by providing functions to retrieve, organize, and analyze environmental time series data.</p>
<p>The development version of this package lives on <a href="https://github.com/fawda123/SWMPr">GitHub</a>. It can be installed from CRAN and loaded in R as follows:</p>

[code lang="r"]
install.packages('SWMPr')
library(SWMPr)
[/code]

SWMP data are maintained online by the Centralized Data Management Office (<a href="http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/">CDMO</a>).  Time series data describing water quality, nutrient, or weather observations can be downloaded for any of the 28 estuaries.  Several functions are provided by the SWMPr package that allow import of data from CDMO into R, either through direct download through the existing web services or by local (<code>import_local</code>) or remote (<code>import_remote</code>) sources.  Imported data are loaded as <code>swmpr </code> objects with several attributes following standard S3 object methods.  The remaining functions in the package are used to organize and analyze the data using a mix of standard methods for time series and more specific approaches developed specifically for SWMP.  This blog concludes with a brief summary of the available functions, organized by category.  As always, be sure to consult the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SWMPr/SWMPr.pdf">help documentation</a> for more detailed information. 

I've also created two shiny applications to illustrate the functionality provided by the package.  The <a href="https://beckmw.shinyapps.io/swmp_comp">first shiny app</a> evaluates trends in SWMP data within and between sites using an interactive map.  Trends between reserves can be viewed using the map, whereas trends at individual sites can be viewed by clicking on a map location.  The data presented on the map were imported and processed using the <code>import_local</code>, <code>qaqc</code>, and <code>aggregate</code> functions.  The <a href="https://beckmw.shinyapps.io/swmp_summary">second app</a> provides graphical summaries of water quality, weather, or nutrient data at individual stations using the <code>plot_summary</code> function. Data were also processed with the <code>import_local</code>, <code>qaqc</code>, and <code>aggregate</code> functions.

<h2>SWMPr functions</h2>
Below is a brief description of each function in the SWMPr package.  I'm currently working on a manuscript to describe use of the package in much greater detail.  For now, please visit our <a href="http://swmprats.net/workshop-2014/">website</a> that introduced version 1.0.0 of the SWMPr package (check the modules tab).  
<h3>Retrieve</h3>
<table>
<tr><td><code>all_params</code></td><td>Retrieve up to 100 records starting with the most recent at a given station, all parameters. Wrapper to <code>exportAllParamsXMLNew</code> function on web services.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>all_params_dtrng</code></td><td> Retrieve records of all parameters within a given date range for a station. Optional argument for a single parameter. Maximum of 1000 records. Wrapper to <code>exportAllParamsDateRangeXMLNew</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>import_local</code></td><td> Import files from a local path. The files must be in a specific format, specifically those returned from the CDMO using the <a href="http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/aqs/zips.cfm">zip downloads</a> option for a reserve.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>import_remote</code></td><td> Import SWMP site data from a remote independent server. These files have been downloaded from CDMO, processed using functions in this package, and uploaded to an Amazon server for quicker import into R.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>single_param</code></td><td> Retrieve up to 100 records for a single parameter starting with the most recent at a given station. Wrapper to <code>exportSingleParamXMLNew</code> function on web services.</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Organize</h3>
<table>
<tr><td><code>comb.swmpr</code></td><td> Combines swmpr objects to a common time series using setstep, such as combining the weather, nutrients, and water quality data for a single station. Only different data types can be combined.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>qaqc.swmpr</code></td><td> Remove QAQC columns and remove data based on QAQC flag values for a swmpr object. Only applies if QAQC columns are present.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>qaqcchk.swmpr</code></td><td> View a summary of the number of observations in a swmpr object that are assigned to different QAQC flags used by CDMO. The output is used to inform further processing but is not used explicitly.</td></tr>
